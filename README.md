Welcome to the **Code-a-Pookkalam** competition hosted by **TinkerHub RIT**! This is a fun and creative coding competition where participants have to code their very own **Pookkalam** (floral design) using programming skills. The challenge is conducted every year during **Onam** to celebrate the spirit of the festival with a technical twist!

## üé® What is a Pookkalam?

A **Pookkalam** is a traditional floral decoration made with colorful flowers, laid out in intricate patterns during the Onam festival in Kerala. In **Code-a-Pookkalam**, participants will replicate this art using code!
