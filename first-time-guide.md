# ðŸŒ¸ Is it Your First Time Participating in Code-a-Pookkalam? ðŸŒ¸

If this is your first time participating in **Code-a-Pookkalam**, welcome! Donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re new to coding or unsure about how to create your own Pookkalam using code â€” weâ€™re here to help. This guide will walk you through the basics and get you started.

## ðŸŽ¨ Use Any Language or Platform

In **Code-a-Pookkalam**, you are free to use any programming language or platform that you are comfortable with to design your Pookkalam. However, if you are a **beginner**, we recommend starting with one of these two beginner-friendly options:

### 1. **p5.js (JavaScript)**

p5.js is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create graphics and interactive visuals in your browser. Itâ€™s an excellent choice for beginners because:
- You can see the output immediately in your browser.
- The syntax is simple and beginner-friendly.
- Itâ€™s highly versatile and can be used for creative coding.

You can get started with p5.js online without installing anything by visiting the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

Example: A simple flower using p5.js:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(255);
  translate(width / 2, height / 2);
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ellipse(0, 0, 150, 50);
    rotate(PI / 5);
  }
}
```

### 2. **Python Turtle**

Pythonâ€™s Turtle library is another beginner-friendly option that allows you to create graphics by controlling a virtual "turtle." Itâ€™s intuitive and great for creating patterns like Pookkalams.

You can use Python Turtle if:
- You are more familiar with Python.
- You want a simple and easy-to-learn library for drawing.

Example: A simple flower using Python's Turtle:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.speed(0)

for i in range(36):
    t.circle(100)
    t.right(10)

turtle.done()
```

### 3. **Joy**

Joy is a tiny creative coding library in Python, made by FOSS United India
See how to use Joy: https://github.com/fossunited/joy/blob/main/README.md

### Other Languages

You are free to use any language that supports graphical output, such as:
- **JavaScript (HTML5 Canvas)**
- **Java (AWT/Swing)**
- **C++ (Graphics libraries)**
- **Processing**
- Or any other platform...

## ðŸ”— Submitting Your Code via GitHub

Once youâ€™ve created your Pookkalam design using the language of your choice, the next step is to submit it. For this competition, **submissions are done through GitHub**. Donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re new to GitHub â€” hereâ€™s a quick guide to help you get started.
