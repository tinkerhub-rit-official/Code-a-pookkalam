# 🌸 Is it Your First Time Participating in Code-a-Pookkalam? 🌸

If this is your first time participating in **Code-a-Pookkalam**, welcome! Don’t worry if you’re new to coding or unsure about how to create your own Pookkalam using code — we’re here to help. This guide will walk you through the basics and get you started.

## 🎨 Use Any Language or Platform

In **Code-a-Pookkalam**, you are free to use any programming language or platform that you are comfortable with to design your Pookkalam. However, if you are a **beginner**, we recommend starting with one of these two beginner-friendly options:

### 1. **p5.js (JavaScript)**

p5.js is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create graphics and interactive visuals in your browser. It’s an excellent choice for beginners because:
- You can see the output immediately in your browser.
- The syntax is simple and beginner-friendly.
- It’s highly versatile and can be used for creative coding.

#### Why p5.js?
- **Beginner-friendly** — you can start with no coding experience. 🚀
- You can run your code directly in the browser — *no need to install anything*! 🌐
- Tons of resources to help you along the way. 📚

#### Getting Started with p5.js
1. **Visit the p5.js Website**:  
   Go to the [p5.js website](https://p5js.org/) to get familiar with what it is and explore its possibilities.

2. **Learn with Tutorials**:  
   Head over to the [p5.js tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials/) to start learning the basics, like drawing shapes, adding colors, and more. 🖍️

3. **Write Code in the Online Editor**:  
   You don’t need to download any software! You can code directly in the browser. Just visit the [p5.js online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) and start coding right away. 💻

   Here’s a simple example to get you started:
   ```javascript
   function setup() {
     createCanvas(400, 400);
     background(255);  // Set the background color to white
     ellipse(200, 200, 150, 150);  // Draw a circle
   }
   ```

### 2. **Python Turtle**

#### What is Python Turtle?
**Python Turtle** is another beginner-friendly way to create graphics with code. You can use simple commands to make a virtual “turtle” move around the screen and draw shapes, making it perfect for designing pookalam patterns.

#### Why Python Turtle?
- **Very simple to learn** — you can start drawing with just a few lines of code. ✨
- It’s fun and visual, making it ideal for creative projects like this. 🎨

#### Getting Started with Python Turtle

1. **Use the Python Turtle Online Editor**:  
   No need to install Python on your computer! Just go to the [Python Turtle online editor](https://pythonsandbox.com/turtle) and start coding in your browser. 🌟

2. **Learn the Basics with Tutorials**:  
   If you’re new to Python or Turtle, don’t worry! Check out the [Python Turtle tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/turtle-programming-python/) to get started with the basics. 📘

3. **Try This Simple Code**:  
   Here’s a small example that draws a circle:
   ```python
   import turtle

   pookalam = turtle.Turtle()
   pookalam.circle(100)  # Draw a circle with a radius of 100 units
   turtle.done()
  ```

### 3. **Joy**

Joy is a tiny creative coding library in Python, made by FOSS United India
See how to use Joy: [https://github.com/fossunited/joy/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/fossunited/joy/blob/main/README.md)

### Other Languages

You are free to use any language that supports graphical output, such as:
- **JavaScript (HTML5 Canvas)**
- **Java (AWT/Swing)**
- **C++ (Graphics libraries)**
- **Processing**
- Or any other platform...

### Choose Your Platform and Let Your Creativity Flow! 🎨✨

Whichever platform you choose — *p5.js* or *Python Turtle* — creating a virtual pookalam is all about having fun and letting your creativity flow. Don’t worry if you’re a beginner; both platforms are designed to be easy to use, and there are plenty of resources to guide you along the way.

Good luck, and we can’t wait to see your pookalams! 🌸🚀
